This Directory contains code to provide APIs for Lower Level REMOTE Control over the Drone's onboard System.
Basically The code here is an alternative to the Onboard ControlAbstraction, provided simply
to offload the board from control related calculations and computation.
This Directory also provides APIs for Manual Physical Remote Control as well as abstraction to enable it to run over 
the Microsoft AirSim Simulatior.
